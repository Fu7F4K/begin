TODO:: 
	We should be able to drag'n drop files into a GUI and get 
	the compiled file with a question to path
	
	When decompiling and saving is finished or the user wants to exit 
	we should get back to shell
	Better would be for the shell to not wait for the user to leave gui 
	window but open it in another window
